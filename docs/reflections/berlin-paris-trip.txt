My solo weekend trip to Berlin and Paris to win â‚¬10k

2024

This is a placeholder for your Berlin-Paris trip reflection. 

Write your story here about how you traveled solo to win the hackathon, the challenges you faced, and the lessons learned about taking risks and thinking differently.

You can add more paragraphs by leaving blank lines between them, just like in your REVER reflection.
